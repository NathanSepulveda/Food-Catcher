This was an exercise in creating my own database as a .json file and serving it with json-server. Additional data was grabbed from https://world.openfoodfacts.org/ to populate the HTML representations of the food objects on the DOM. 

Some of the data, particularily that of the ingredients, was imperfect with many duplicates, inconsistent capitalization, and sentences in place of ingredients. Various methods, albeit imperfect, were used to clean up the data before it was printed to the DOM.
